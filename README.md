## About
#### This repository contains the scripts need to generate the figure for the manuscript "Membrane-bound Guanylyl Cyclase COP5/HKR1 changes ciliary beat pattern and biases cell steering during chemotaxis in _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_". It is split into four sections:

Note: Each section is accompanied by sample datasets of a positive control (typically the *wt* CC-125) and a negative control (typically the paralyzed _pf18_)
1. [CHEMOTAXIS](https://github.com/AlaSummer/Chlamy-2024/tree/main/CHEMOTAXIS)
   - Code and procedures required the process data from the 3D printed Chemotaxis Lane Assay (CLA) plate
   - STL file reqired to print the CLA-plate
2. [PHOTOTAXIS](https://github.com/AlaSummer/Chlamy-2024/tree/main/PHOTOTAXIS)
   - Code for processing phototaxis experiements
3. [DIFFUSION](https://github.com/AlaSummer/Chlamy-2024/tree/main/DIFFUSION)
   - Code for finding diffusion coefficients of BPB based on curve fitting.
3. [swimTRACKING](https://github.com/AlaSummer/Chlamy-2024/tree/main/swimTRACKING)
   - Code for processing all microscopy video of cell tracking including photoshock, homogenous non-gradient conditions, and gradient conditions.
